    <!-- Character Entities -->

    <!-- Many symbols and special characters are required while developing a web page in html, but as we know that 
 sometimes the use of characters directly may interfere with the actual html code which have certain characters
 reserved and also certain characters being not available on keyboard. Thus, to avoid the conflict and at same time
 to be able to use different symbols in our code w3 org provides us with 'Character Entities'. -->

    <!-- A simple example with the use of character entity for 'magnifying glass'  -->
